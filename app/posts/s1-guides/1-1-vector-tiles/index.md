GEP Explorer consumes geo data from vector tilesets in order to render a map of scenarios in an efficient way. Every model should have a vector tileset defined in its configuration. At the moment, the GEP Explorer only supports polygon geometries (clusters), not point data.

Each geometry in the dataset should have a single property `id`, of type integer. Other properties should be discarded as they will not be used by the web client and will increase tile size.

A recommended way to generate and host a vector tileset is to use [the command-line tool tippecanoe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tippecanoe) and upload the resulting MBTiles file to Mapbox Studio.

An example command to generate MBTiles from GeoJSON:


    tippecanoe -o gep-features.mbtiles gep-features.geojson

The option `--drop-densest-as-needed` should be avoided, if possible, as it limits the number of features displayed on the map at national level, affecting visual analysis.
