#### List existing models
Outputs the existing models in the database. Example:

    node cli/ list

#### Delete existing models
Deletes the models and respective data that match the given ids. Example:

    node cli/ delete mw-1 mw-2

#### Validate model output before ingest
Validates the model and data at the given `path`. The path should point to the directory where the model and data are stored, not to the model itself. Example:

    node cli/ validate ./data/mw-1/

#### Ingest a model
Ingests the model and data at the given `path`. The path should point to the directory where the model and data are stored, not to the model itself. Example:

    node cli/ ingest ./data/mw-1/

If there is a model with the same id in the database the command will fail. If you want to re-ingest the model and override the existent one use the `--override` flag. Example:

    node cli/ ingest --override ./data/mw-1/

#### Update a existing model
Updates the non-data parts of model found at the given `path`. The path should point to the directory where the model and data are stored, not to the model itself.
While it is not possible to update data related configurations (like levers and filters) without performing a full ingest, it is allowed to update metadata information, like descriptions and labels. Example:

    node cli/ ingest --config-only ./data/mw-1/

The following model properties can only be modified when doing a full ingest and the script will error if theyâ€™re changed:

    id
    country
    timesteps
    levers (for each lever object)
      id
      options (for each option object)
        id
        value
    filters (for each filter object)
      id
      key
      type
      timestep
      options (for each option object)
        id
        value
